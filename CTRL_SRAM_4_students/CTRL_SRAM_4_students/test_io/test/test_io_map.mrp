Design Summary
--------------
Number of errors:      0
Number of warnings:    0
Logic Utilization:
Logic Distribution:
    Number of Slices containing only related logic:       0 out of       0   0%
    Number of Slices containing unrelated logic:          0 out of       0   0%
      *See NOTES below for an explanation of the effects of unrelated logic.

  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  Number of bonded IOBs:                  4 out of     768    1%

Average Fanout of Non-Clock Nets:                1.69

Peak Memory Usage:  273 MB
Total REAL time to MAP completion:  17 secs 
Total CPU time to MAP completion:   8 secs 

NOTES:

   Related logic is defined as being logic that shares connectivity - e.g. two
   LUTs are "related" if they share common inputs.  When assembling slices,
   Map gives priority to combine logic that is related.  Doing so results in
   the best timing performance.

   Unrelated logic shares no connectivity.  Map will only begin packing
   unrelated logic into a slice once 99% of the slices are occupied through
   related logic packing.

   Note that once logic distribution reaches the 99% level through related
   logic packing, this does not mean the device is completely utilized.
   Unrelated logic packing will then begin, continuing until all usable LUTs
   and FFs are occupied.  Depending on your timing budget, increased levels of
   unrelated logic packing may adversely affect the overall timing performance
   of your design.

Section 3 - Informational
-------------------------
INFO:LIT:243 - Logical network CLK has no load.
INFO:LIT:395 - The above info message is repeated 1 more times for the following
   (max. 5 shown):
   nRESET
   To see the details of these info messages, please use the -detail switch.
INFO:MapLib:562 - No environment variables are currently set.
INFO:MapLib:797 - Your design is targeting LX/SX Production Step 0/1/ES devices.
   Please note that there are new specifications for the DCMs to guarantee
   maximum frequency performance. If the DCM input clock might stop or if the
   DCM reset might be asserted for an extended time, then use of the dcm_standby
   macro may be required. Please see Answer Record 21127.
